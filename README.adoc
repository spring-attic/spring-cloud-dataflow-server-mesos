= Mesos/Marathon Deployer implementation

SPI implementation for deploying https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] modules to
 https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon[Marathon].

== Quick install using playa-mesos

1. Install Mesos and Marathon from https://github.com/mesosphere/playa-mesos
(_i.e._ clone and `vagrant up`)

2. Build and install this repository:
+
```
./mvnw install
```
+
You'll want to `install`, because this deployer currently relies on
`spring-cloud-marathon-connector` that will need to be in your local maven repository later.
This requirement (and step 4 below) will be later alleviated when `spring-cloud-marathon-connector`
is published as an official Spring Cloud Connector.

3. The SPI currently assumes that there will be a running redis Marathon app running, named `redis`.
+
One way to create one is to have Marathon run the `redis` docker image:
+
```
curl -X POST http://10.141.141.10:8080/v2/apps -d @src/etc/marathon/redis.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
```
+
With `redis.json` containing
+
[source, json]
```
{
  "id": "redis",
  "cpus": 0.5,
  "mem": 64.0,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "redis",
      "network": "BRIDGE",
      "portMappings": [
        { "containerPort": 6379 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Expose your host's maven repository over http so that it can be accessed from
the running marathon apps:
+
```
cd ~/.m2/repository
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
+
Also note your host IP address, later denoted as `<HostIP>`

5. Launch admin server
+
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-mesos/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-mesos-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --marathon.apiEndpoint=http://10.141.141.10:8080 --marathon.launcherProperties.remoteRepositories=http://<HostIP>:8000
```

6. Launch shell and create ticktock stream
