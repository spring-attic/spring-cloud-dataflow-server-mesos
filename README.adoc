# Spring Cloud Dataflow Server for Apache Mesos

This project provides support for deploying https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow[Spring Cloud Data Flow]'s streaming data pipelines to Apache Mesos using Marathon and Chronos. It includes an implementation of Spring Cloud Data Flow’s https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer[Deployer SPI] using Marathon for stream apps and Chronos for task apps.


The Spring Cloud Data Flow team have been happy stewards of this project, but now feel that TrustedChoice will be a better home, and we are donating the project to them to carry it forward. 

Please see https://github.com/trustedchoice/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos[the new github repository] for the latest on this project as the Spring Cloud Data Flow team will no longer maintain it.
