== Test Cluster
Here are brief setup instructions for setting up a local Vagrant DC/OS Mesos cluster. The DC/OS Dashboard endpoint will be https://m1.dcos[https://m1.dcos], the Mesos endpoint will be https://m1.dcos/mesos[https://m1.dcos/mesos], the Marathon endpoint will be https://m1.dcos/marathon[https://m1.dcos/marathon] and the Chronos endpoint will be https://m1.dcos/service/chronos[https://m1.dcos/service/chronos].

Detailed installation instructions are here: https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant[https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant]

=== Clone and Download files

First clone the `dcos-vagrant` project:

    git clone https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant.git

Copy the config file you'd like to use (the best file to use for our purposes is `VagrantConfig-1m-3a-1p.yaml`). From the root directory of the `dcos-vagrant` project execute:

    cp VagrantConfig-1m-3a-1p.yaml VagrantConfig.yaml

Copy the `etc/config-1.8.yaml` file to `etc/config.yaml` and then add a line with 

`oauth_enabled: 'false'` 

to the end of this file and save it. This will disable any security for the cluster.

=== Start Vagrant VMs for the Mesos cluster

You need to install VirtualBox, Vagrant and Vagrant Host Manager Plugin. See https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant#quick-start[Quick Start]. 

Download the DC/OS version you want to use, we used version 1.8.8 from https://dcos.io/releases/1.8.8/[https://dcos.io/releases/1.8.8/], and place this `dcos_generate_config.sh` file in the root directory of the cloned `dcos-project`.

Before we start the cluster we should define the config files we want to use:

    export DCOS_CONFIG_PATH=etc/config.yaml
    export DCOS_GENERATE_CONFIG_PATH=dcos_generate_config.sh

Now we are ready to start the Vagrant VMs. You can select different cluster configurations depending on your needs. We have tested using a single master, two private agents and one bootstrap node using this command:

    vagrant up m1 a1 a2 boot

When you are done with the Mesos cluster you can destroy it using:

    vagrant destroy -f

=== Install Chronos as a Service running in Marathon 

You can install Chronos by using the following `dcos` command. This requires that you install the  https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.8/usage/cli/install/[DC/OS CLI].

    dcos package install chronos

NOTE: The more recent DC/OS versions include Marathon version 3.0 which has changed the API endpoints. The 1.2 version of Spring Cloud Deployer for Mesos now support this Chronos 3.0 version but it is no longer compatible with older Chronos versions.
